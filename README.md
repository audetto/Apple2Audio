# Apple ][ Speaker emulation

`audio.txt` containes the cycle numbers of the speaker access using [A2Stream](https://github.com/oliverschmidt/A2Stream) with [TimeToSayGoodbye](http://a2retro.de/a2s/TimeToSayGoodbye.a2stream).

A few different `wav` files are produced.

For simplicity the CPU speed is an exact multiple (23)  of 44100.
